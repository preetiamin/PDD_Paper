## Documentation

This code aims to reproduce results produced in the paper by Elujide et al. The code implements baseline models used in the paper including Support Vector Machines, Random Forest, Decision Trees, Multilayer Perceptron and additionally XGBoost. The paper also implements the deep learning model implemented in the paper. More details about the architecture and hyperparameters can be found in jupyter notebook and project report.
